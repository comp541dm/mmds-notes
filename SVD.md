# Singular Value Decomposition
- SVD can be looked at from three points of view
  - method for transforming correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated ones that better expose the varioous relationships among the original data items.
  - method for identifying and ordering the dimensions along which data points exhibit the most variation
  - third way of viewing svd: Once we have identified where the most variation is, it is possible to find the best approximation of the original point using fewer dimensions.
- Take a high dimensional, highly variable set of data points and reduce it to a lower dimensional space that exposes the substructure of the original data more clearly and orders it from most variation of the least.
